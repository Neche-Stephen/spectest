## Get started

A spectest is a collection of request and response pairs. <br>
With spectest, you declare requests the way you would pass them to the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). Spectest mirrors the [request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) schemas of normal browser/nodejs fetch requests.

#### 1. Define your request and response

```js
// file:jsonpayload.suite.js

const suite = [
  {
    name: "Fetch TODO 1",
    endpoint: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1",
  },
  {
    name: "Create a post",
    endpoint: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts",
    request: {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8" },
      body: { title: "foo", body: "bar", userId: 1 },
    },
    response: {
      status: 201,
      json: { id: 101, title: "foo", body: "bar", userId: 1 },
    },
  },
];
export default suite;

```

#### 2. Run the test

```bash
$ npx spectest jsonpayload.suite.js

--------- ouput --------

```

## Why Spectest
While building an API, I kept running into the same frustrating loop: after writing comprehensive Jest tests, I still had to manually ‚Äúverify‚Äù the API by running it through a frontend client.

Here‚Äôs why Jest alone wasn‚Äôt enough:

1. **Mocks obscure reality** ‚Äì Jest enables mocking which simulate behavior but can hide real issues in production.

2. **Multi-step flows were painful** ‚Äì Chaining flows like `login ‚Üí verify ‚Üí fetch` was hard to write and even harder to maintain.

3. **No browser-like behavior** ‚Äì Jest couldn‚Äôt replicate real-world HTTP behavior like cookie persistence or automatic attachment.

4. **API-centric needs were missing** ‚Äì Load testing, proxying, and concurrency checks weren‚Äôt feasible out of the box.

What I really needed was a way to **verify my API** contract the same way a frontend does‚Äîbut **without** reaching for heavyweight tools like Selenium or Playwright.

That‚Äôs where Spectest was born‚Äîout of necessity.


## Spectest config

To define common behavior for how and when requests, create a `spectest.config.js` file at the project root.
Below is the default config:

```js
export default {
  envFile: '.env',
  startCmd: 'npm run start',
  baseUrl: 'https://localhost:8080',
  suitesDir: './spec',
  testMatch: '\\.(suite|suites)\\.js$',
  rps: Infinity,
  timeout: 30000,
  randomize: false,
  bail: false,
  happy: false,
  runningServer: 'reuse',
  userAgent: 'chrome_windows',
};
```

### Controlling request rate

To avoid overwhelming your server during test runs, Spectest supports a **requests per second (rps)** option. Set `rps` in `spectest.config.js` or pass `--rps=<number>` on the command line. A simple token bucket limiter ensures that no more than the configured number of requests are sent each second.

### Test timeout

Use the `timeout` option to limit how long each test case may run. Specify `timeout` in `spectest.config.js` or pass `--timeout=<milliseconds>` on the command line. The default is `30000` (30 seconds). Individual tests can override this by including a `timeout` property. When a request exceeds the effective timeout, the test fails with a `‚è∞` indicator in the summary.

### Randomizing test order

Use the `--randomize` flag or set `randomize: true` in `spectest.config.js` to shuffle tests that share the same `order` value. This helps catch hidden dependencies without changing the overall order of distinct groups.

### Bailing on first failure

Pass the `--bail` flag or set `bail: true` in `spectest.config.js` to stop executing
lower-order test groups once a failure is detected. Any remaining tests are
marked as skipped in the summary.

### Saving snapshots

Use the `--snapshot=<file>` option to write the executed test cases to a JSON
file. The snapshot contains a `lastUpdate` timestamp and a `cases` array. Each
case records the final request that was sent, the actual server response, the
result status (`pass`, `fail`, or `timeout`), and the latency in milliseconds.
If a snapshot file already exists, only the cases that were executed are
overwritten so skipped tests keep their previous data.

### Happy path filtering

Use the `--happy` flag or set `happy: true` in `spectest.config.js` to run only
tests whose expected `response.status` falls between 200 and 299. If a test
omits `response.status` it is treated as `200` for this check.

### Setting the User-Agent

All requests use a browser-like **User-Agent** header. Specify a custom agent
using `--user-agent=<name>` (or `--ua=<name>`) or set `userAgent` in
`fest.config.js`. The value may be one of the pre-defined names from
`chrome_windows`, `chrome_mac`, `chrome_android`, `chrome_ios`, `edge_windows`,
`safari_mac`, `safari_ios`, `firefox_windows`, `firefox_mac`, or
`opera_windows`. Any other value is used literally.
